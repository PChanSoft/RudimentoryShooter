# RudimentoryShooter
My game will be about simply going through rounds of enemies and make it to the end of X rounds, with progressing difficulty.

Rules:
You control a space ship with guns, shoot at the enemy ships while dodging return fire! Each round will have different formations of enemies to shoot against.

Controls:
ship moves left and right with keys
ship can fire bullets with a button


To keeps things simple, we will just have standard ships, that also shoot back occasionally.

---------Day 1---------

Figure out how to move ship in a confined space

---------Day 2---------

To create the hit detection when the ships go pew so we know if a ship got hit or not for scoring purposes later. Will integrate the method as described here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection

The trick will be then pulling the current value of X and Y axis of enemy ships as they move. 
When collision happens enemy ship will be destroyed, or player ship will be destroyed
if it collides with enemey fire.

--------Day 3-----------

Make ships go pew

--------Day 4-----------

how to produce different waves of enemies

--------Day 5-----------

Scoring

--------Day 6-----------

Cry
